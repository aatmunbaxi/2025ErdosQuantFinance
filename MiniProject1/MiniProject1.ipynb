Invest in low cost, total market index funds at a 90% stock/10% bond split\n2.  Stocks should be diversified globally\n3.  The bond portion will be zero coupon 25+ year Treasury STRIPS\n\nThe rationale for minimizing cost is self-evident, and we introduce a 10% bond allocation due to its curtailing of psychological risk and improving of risk-adjusted returns.\nOur duration exposure to the bonds should be in line with our consumption timeline.\nAs such, we adopt ultra-long dated Treasury STRIPS, as opposed to a total bond market fund, which would have an average duration in the intermediate length of ~6 years.\nIt has been demonstrated that STRIPS have lower correlation with stocks, and would provide a stronger diversification benefit, which is desirable in our framework.\n\nOur &ldquo;low risk&rdquo; portfolio will consist of 90% VT and 10% ZROZ.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9b52ff60-7d3a-49e1-984a-8a3542fc4b9b","metadata":{},"source":["## Risk Factors and Sources of Increased Risk\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3e84be23-7baa-4f21-8f01-b080ec827d19","metadata":{},"source":["In Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the &ldquo;low&rdquo; risk portfolio\n\n"]}],"metadata":{"org":null,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
