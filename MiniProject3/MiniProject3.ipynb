    "# Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "At a constant spot price of $100$ and strike price of $110$, both the\n",
    "call and put options decayed in price as the expiry time approached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Call Option\n",
    "\n",
    "The decay of the call option accelerated as the time to expiry got\n",
    "closer and closer. This can be formalized by the hypothesis that the\n",
    "second partial derivative of $P_c$ with respect to the time to expiry is\n",
    "a strictly negative function of time. i.e. the price-time to expiry\n",
    "relationship is concave down when the strike is OTM. This quantity is\n",
    "known as *theta*, and is one of the fundamental greeks used in options\n",
    "analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the spot was constantly OTM, the option expires worthless.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Put Option\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the analysis of the put option is identical to that of the call\n",
    "option, with the notable difference that the strike for the put option\n",
    "is in the money, hence the option expires with a positive value. The\n",
    "shape of the graph is identical, which suggests that theta is a function\n",
    "independent of in-the-moneyness The only effect of the in-the-moneyness\n",
    "on the price of the put is that is expires with a nonzero value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theta Decay\n",
    "\n",
    "The phenomenon of price decay as expiry approaches (and the quickening\n",
    "of said decay as time passes) suggests that traders buying near-dated\n",
    "options (e.g. weeklys) with the intent to sell them for profit must be\n",
    "extra careful, as they are fighting against the decay of the asset as\n",
    "time passes. This would require their delta exposure to be high enough\n",
    "to counteract theta decay, or else the option, even if it ended ITM,\n",
    "would be worth less by virtue of being closer to expiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side of this trade, one could sell options close to expiry\n",
    "and buy them back with the hopes that theta decay has made them worth\n",
    "less. Of course, this assumes the spot has not changed enough for the\n",
    "trade to go against them. Strategies like covered calls and cash-secured\n",
    "puts are examples of strategies that pocket option premium in the event\n",
    "of worthless value and expiry. Multi-leg option strategies also usually\n",
    "involve a short position as a hedge against a possible loss on another\n",
    "leg of the trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spot Sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Call Option\n",
    "\n",
    "As we would expect, the price of a call option increases with respect to\n",
    "spot price, with a concave up shape. This suggests that the delta of the\n",
    "call option increases as the spot increases assuming time is kept\n",
    "constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect this to be true since call options give a buyer the right to\n",
    "buy the underlying at the strike price, and as the spot approaches (or\n",
    "supasses) the strike price, the right to buy at the cheaper strike price\n",
    "would command a higher cost An immediate exercise would guarantee a more\n",
    "favorable entry into the underlying in this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope levels off as the spot far exceeds the strike, which makes\n",
    "sense as delta is a value bounded above by $1$ in the long position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together with the observation of theta decay being lower as expiry is\n",
    "further out, this has an interesting consequence. At deltas close to\n",
    "$1$, one can get near equivalent exposure to 100 units of the underlying\n",
    "asset by buying deep ITM options for only the price of the premium they\n",
    "paid for the contracts. In this sense, options can act as leverage for a\n",
    "particular position a trader wants to take in the underlying. LEAPs are\n",
    "an example of this in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Put Option\n",
    "\n",
    "The put option sees the inverse of the call option. As the spot\n",
    "increases, the option decreases in value, which is expected, since\n",
    "selling the underlying at a lower price than the strike should carry a\n",
    "lower premium. Notably, the premium is still positive despite the spot\n",
    "being lower than the strike. Since we are assuming a constant time (1\n",
    "year) to expiry, there is still time for the price of the underlying to\n",
    "make its way back above the strike, so we should **not** expect the\n",
    "price of the put to be zero."
